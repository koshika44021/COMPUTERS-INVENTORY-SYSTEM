        <h1>Indian Ordnance Factories Service</h1>
        <p>The Indian Ordnance Factories Service (IOFS) is a civil service of the Government of India. IOFS officers are Gazetted (Group A) defence-civilian officers under the Ministry of Defence. They are responsible for the administration of the Indian Ordnance Factories, which provide the indigenous defence production capabilities of India.The Indian Ordnance Factories predate all the other organisations like the Indian Army and the Indian Railways by over a century. The first Indian ordnance factory can trace its origins back to the year 1712 when the Dutch Ostend Company established a Gun Powder Factory in Ichhapur.[25] In 1787, another gunpowder factory was established at Ichapore; it began production in 1791, and the site was later used as a rifle factory, beginning in 1904. In 1801, Gun Carriage Agency (now known as Gun & Shell Factory, Cossipore) was established at Cossipore, Calcutta, and production began on 18 March 1802. This is the oldest ordnance factory in India still in existence.</p>
        <h1>Composition</h1>
        <p>During the colonial times, the administrative service of Ordnance was known as the Indian Ordnance Service. It was constituted in the year 1935. It had only European officers in the years that followed. Only engineering graduates from the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, etc., were allowed to appear in the examination. They had to undergo specialised training prior to joining the service. In 1939, there was only one Indian officer and the remaining forty-four officers were of European origin.

        IOFS was reconstituted in its present form in 1954 with the cadre controlling authority of Ministry of Defence – Department of Defence Production, with a cadre size of 1760 posts. The source of recruitment was through direct recruitment 60%; by promotion 40% and no lateral entries.

        IOFS is a multi-disciplinary composite cadre consisting of technical – engineers (Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Electronics), technologists (Aerospace, Automotive, Marine, Industrial/Product design, Computer, Nuclear, Optical, Chemical, Metallurgical, Textile, leather) and non-technical/administrative (Science, Law, Commerce, Management and Arts graduates). Technical posts account for about 87% of the total cadre. The doctors (Surgeons and Physicians) serving in OFB belong to a separate service known as the Indian Ordnance Factories Health Service (IOFHS). IOFHS officers are responsible for the maintenance of health of the employees, and the hospitals of OFB. They report directly to the IOFS officers. IOFS and IOFHS are the only two civil services under the Department of Defence Production.</p>
        <h1>OFB's background</h1>
